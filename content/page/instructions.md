# User Guide

This is the user guide for the web application WOPFE. In WOPFE, it is possible to sign in as a manager,
an admin, a teacher, and a student.

Shortly about all users:

A manager has a table with all users using this application and can add new admins.

An admin is the user, who is responsible for creating new teachers, students, and timetables.

A teacher can see classes, a list of students, and timetables. Also, the teacher can create tests for students.
